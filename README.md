# Banana Allergy Game [Vanilla JS version]

Vanilla JavaScript version of my previously jQuery based Banana Allergy game, made using the [Memory Game tutorial by Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania/memory-game) as a starting point. [See me talking about making this for Free Code Camp Oklahoma](https://youtu.be/RLmjk2v9O5I). You can [play the game yourself](https://m-mackey.github.io/Banana-Allergy-Game-Vanilla-JS/). Unfortunately, you can't actually win right now, only play until you lose. Bummer! I've thought about updating it someday, but it is an old project now, and I kind of want to move on to newer things.

Art by me.
